            <p class="paragraph-18px text-color-gray align_center m-top-20">My name is Jeff Gunther. I’ve been active in real estate investment since age 21. I negotiated hundreds of transactions as an Alberta Realtor® before serving as National Trainer with one of Canada’s largest real estate organizations. As a consultant, I’ve enjoyed working with national mortgage brokerages and investment houses.<br><br>Most good real estate brokers and bankers discover early on that the easiest way to earn a living is to stick to the simple stuff and do it often. And sometimes salespeople are tempted to take shortcuts that could cost you time, aggravation, or thousands of dollars.<br><br>While I’ve developed lifelong friendships with many of my former colleagues, I also clearly understand the benefits and limitations of their chosen professions. The unfortunate truth is that traditional methods of buying and selling houses don’t always work so well.<br><br>In 2009, I returned to Edmonton with the specific objective of providing people with clean, safe, affordable housing, and treating tenants with dignity, all while earning a reasonable profit in the process. I love learning new ways to create value by solving people’s problems and believe true genius is found in the ability to clearly communicate what others tend to complicate.</p>
